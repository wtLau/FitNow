# FitNow Mobile Application

## Description

The problem is the current workout app is not very user-friendly, they have a lot of features but missing a lot of other things. I wanted something that can sync from web and mobile app, tracking every entry, be able to add exercise dynamically, contain all exercises by default. In addition to those listed, it will be nice to have timer built in to monitor each set, have different options to suggest weight such as 1rm, 2rm and high reps.

The FitNow app was built using React Native for both android and ios devices, and uses Firebase and Realm as a database.

This project is a side project for personal use.
