**Step 1: Get an idea or a problem.**

The problem is the current app is not very user-friendly, it has a lot
of features but it is also missing a lot of other things. I wanted
something that can sync from web and mobile app, tracking every entry,
be able to add exercise dynamically, contain all exercises by default.
In addition to those listed, it will be nice to have timer built in to
monitor each set, have different options to suggest weight such as 1rm,
2rm and high reps.

Excerise- Built in exercises with animations, and how-to\'s

Programs- Fully customizable workout programs

Calendar- Complete history of all your workout logs, notes, and more

Plate calculator- Nobody wants to do math during a workout

Statistics- Stats and graphs for every exercise

Bodystats- Track body weight, fat, BMI, and other measurements

Progress pics- Use the camera to record or import progress pics

Themes- Change things up with 12 different color themes

Dynamic inputs- Log weight, reps, calories, time, and distance

Timer- Countdown rest timer and stopwatch 

Backup- Keep your data safe backup to the cloud

Spreadsheet- Export your exercise logs to a spreadsheet

**Step 2: Identify the need.** 

Validation will prove that a demand exists for your app. You can
validate your idea by using the Google Keyword Planner tool to look for
the number of people seeking out what you're trying to do. You could
also build a landing page that broadly highlights your app idea and seek
user interest through an email signup.

**Step 3: Lay out the flow and features.**

the flow of how the user will navigate the app as well as all the
features envisioned.

-workout days

-workout

-summary

**Step 4: Remove non-core features**

Do not build features in the first version that are \"nice to have\" and
can always be added later as an update.

**Step 5: Put design first.**

Design is not just about how your app looks, but it's about how a user
will experience the app. 

**Step 6: Hire a designer/developer.** 

**Step 7: Create developer accounts.**

**Step 8: Integrate analytics.** 

**Step 9: Get feedback quickly and improvise**

**Step 10: Introduce features**
